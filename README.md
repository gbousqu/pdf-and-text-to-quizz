# PDF to Quiz

## Important

this code is based on the project of Farid Bellame : https://github.com/fbellame/pdf-to-quizz

## Usage

Upload a multiple page PDF or give a text and generate a quiz.
Through a streamlit form, uou can :

- choose the number of questions generated for each "page" of the document (pdf or text)
- choose, create or modify the "context", i.e the extra exact instructions to pass to openAI
- choose the type of questions for all the quizz : MCQ with one correct option, MCQ with 2 or 3 exact answers, True/false

The UI is based on Streamlit

## Pre-requisite

You need an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Keep in mind this is not free BUT the with the usage of **gpt-3.5-turbo** it's not expensive at all unless you drop really big PDF (more than 100 pages).

```
